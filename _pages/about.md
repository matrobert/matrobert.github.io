Hello! I am currently working at the [NUHS Centre for Healthy Longevity](https://coe.nuhs.edu.sg/centre-for-healthy-longevity) as a research assistant. My research is focused on dissecting the biology and the consequences behind **chemotherapy-induced senescence**, a key driver of cancer recurrence and chemotherapy off-target toxicity. By leveraging on -omics technology, we hope to reveal previously under-appreciated mechanisms that drive therapy-induced senescence and its phenotype, and look for novel intervention opportunity.

I hold a B.Sc in Life Sciences from the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). For more details on my background, please navigate to the CV section.

For more information on other projects in our group, please visit [Genomic Instability & Stress Response Lab](https://www.crastalab.com/), led by Research Asst. Prof. Karen Crasta.
