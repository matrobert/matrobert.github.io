  abstract = {Extrachromosomal circular DNA (ecDNA) or double minutes have gained renewed interest since its discovery more than five decades ago, emerging as potent drivers of tumour evolution. This has largely been motivated by recent discovery that the tumour-exclusive ecDNA are highly prevalent in almost all cancers unlike previously thought. EcDNAs contribute to elevated oncogene expression, intratumoural heterogeneity, tumour adaptation and therapy resistance independently of canonical chromosomal alterations. Importantly, ecDNAs play a critical role in patient survival as ecDNA-based oncogene amplification adversely affects clinical outcome to a significantly greater extent than intrachromosomal amplification. Chromothripsis, a major driver of ecDNA biogenesis and gene amplification, is a mutational process characterised by chromosomal shattering and localised complex genome rearrangement. Chemotherapeutic drugs can lead to chromothriptic rearrangements and therapy resistance. In this review, we examine how ecDNAs mediate oncogene overexpression, facilitate accelerated tumour malignancy and enhance rapid adaptation independently of linear chromosomes. We delve into discoveries pertaining to mechanisms of biogenesis, distinctive features of ecDNA, gene regulation and topological interactions with active chromatin. We also discuss the critical role of chromothripsis in engendering ecDNA amplification and evolution. One envisions that insights into ecDNA biology not only hold importance for the cancer genome and tumour evolutionary dynamics, but could also inform prognostication and clinical intervention, particularly for cancers characterised by high oncogene amplification.}

  abstract = {Therapy-induced senescent tumor cells have emerged as significant drivers of tumor recurrence and disease relapse. Interestingly, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and its associated redox signaling networks are intertwined with initiation and establishment of therapy-induced senescence. Therapy-induced senescent cells influence neighboring cells and the tumor microenvironment via their bioactive secretome known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The intracellular effects of ROS are dose and context-dependent. Under normal physiological conditions, ROS is involved in various signalling pathways and cellular processes important for maintenance of cellular homeostasis, such as redox balance, stress response, inflammatory signalling, cell proliferation and cell death among others. However excess ROS accompanied by a pro-oxidant microenvironment can engender oxidative DNA damage, triggering cellular senescence. In this review, we discuss the role of ROS and the redox state dynamics in fine-tuning homeostatic processes that drive therapy-induced cell fate towards senescence establishment, as well as their influence in stimulating inflammatory signalling and SASP production. We also offer insights into interventional strategies, specifically senotherapeutics, that could potentially leverage on modulation of redox and antioxidant pathways. Lastly, we evaluate possible implications of redox rewiring during escape from therapy-induced senescence, an emerging area of research. We envision that examining therapy-induced senescence through the redox lens, integrated with time-resolved single-cell RNA sequencing combined with spatiotemporal multi-omics, could further enhance our understanding of its functional heterogeneity. This could aid identification of targetable signalling nodes to reduce disease relapse, as well as inform strategies for development of broad-spectrum senotherapeutics. Overall, our review aims to delineate redox-driven mechanisms which contribute to the biology of therapy-induced senescence and beyond, while highlighting implications for tumor initiation and recurrence.}

  abstract = {Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC), associated with poor prognosis and high tumour recurrence, are often-treated with taxanes in first-line treatment regimens. However, acquired disease resistance can often set in, hampering clinical efficacy. One avenue that could engender therapy resistance is therapy-induced senescence (TIS), as they represent a population of residual disease and are highly secretory. Although it is known that TIS can contribute to tumour development and therapy resistance via the therapy-induced secretome, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we sought to dissect the role of the TNBC-derived TIS-associated secretome in chemoresponse. We found that paclitaxel-treated cells induced mitotic slippage and entered senescence as tetraploid cells. The therapy-induced SASP was found to be enriched in soluble cytokines and other pro-tumorigenic factors linked to tumour recurrence and distant metastasis. Interestingly, we found that senescence-associated small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) or exosomes, an underappreciated component of SASP, increased genomic instability, ROS and anti-tumour activity. Exosomal proteomic and transcriptomic profiling further revealed DKK1, a negative regulator of WNT signalling, to be enriched in TIS-sEVs. Further investigation demonstrated DKK1-control of inflammatory cytokines production to confer reduced tumour activity in recipient TNBC cancer cells. Taken together, this study revealed unexpected findings where TIS-sEVs confer opposing tumourigenic outcomes to that elicited by TIS-SASP, indicating that sEVs should be considered as distinct SASP entities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
